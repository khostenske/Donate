					<h2>Vietnam</h2>
					<p>In cooperation with Vietnamese officials and with the support of corporations and individuals around the world, the Vietnam Children’s Fund has been building schools since 1994. Working closely with each community, calling upon local artisans and using readily available materials, VCF constructs schools that are sturdy, safe, and clean. Because a school may be the only well-built structure in a community, it serves as not only a gathering place for residents but is often the only safe haven from the elements during a natural disaster.</p>
			<h2>Project Funding</h2>
				<h3>VCF accepts no government funds. Our funding is all private and comes from individuals, foundations and corporations.</h3>

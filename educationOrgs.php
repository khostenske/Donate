					<h2>United States</h2>
					
					<p>Our mission is to enlist, develop, and mobilize our nation's most promising future leaders to grow and strengthen the movement for educational equity.
					Teach for America began in 1989 as Wendy Kopps senior thesis at Princeton University.  Public schools, decades after desegregation, remained a realm of inequity, unable to make up for
					the long-term effects of poverty, racism, and deeply rooted injustices.  If our country is going to adress this problem, more leaders would need to be grounded in the issues at the classroom level

					<p>Pratham began by providing preschool education to  children in the slums of Mumbai. Before long, the Pratham balwadis (preschool classes) multiplied, and their successful model was adopted in other locations.
					Over the years, the Pratham network has expanded to almost every state in India. Today, our direct programs including preschools, remedial learning programs and vocational classes reach hundreds of thousands of children every year. </p>
